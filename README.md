# Fault-Tolerant-Banking-Service
CMSC 621 (ADVANCED OPERATING SYSTEMS): PROJECT 3 | Fault Tolerant Banking Service (Capable of Multiple Concurrent Operations) 
This project demonstrates fault tolerance with replicated data of bank accounts over 3 bank servers. Atomicity of transactions is attained by using 2 phase commit protocol (2PC) and locking mechanism is implemented to maintain consistency in the database/transactions.
